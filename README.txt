This GUI program is a to do list to which items can be added and can be removed. One can also export the to do list to a text file "todo.txt" by pressing the export button. This however kills the program. 
The name of a task is treated as the primary key in internal operations. Duplicate entries are allowed, but if multiple tasks have same name, they shall be removed simultaneously.

Future scope:
Improving GUI aesthetic and functionality.
